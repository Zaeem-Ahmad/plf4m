										<h2>Leadership Style</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I represent the Teacher leadership style most accurately as the elements present in this leadership style coincide with many of my own leadership strategies and practices. For instance, individuals embodying the Teacher leadership style are adept at leading others through expertise and analysis. Teachers analyze the world, the people, the tasks at hand, and they translate matters of importance fluently into decisive, well-informed decisions. Using intellectual energy, Teachers channel their knack of learning and critical thinking to drive teams forward into accomplishing goals within deadlines.</p>
									<p>Identifying myself as a Teacher was a straightforward task because my various leadership experiences call to the specific elements described above. For example, I used my knowledge of computers, electronics, and software platforms to design a computer basics course at a community organization. By pulling weaving the web and drawing connections among elements such as my past experiences as being a teacher, my expectations as a student, and my in-depth knowledge of the course content that I designed, I was able to develop a coherent course structure aimed at seniors and elderly individuals. For the past two year’s I have been successfully teaching seniors my computer course on weekends. As a Teacher, I constantly analyze my performance and look for indications of success. Students who have studied with me for the past two years have gone from not knowing what Google Chrome was to writing full-on poems and short stories for magazines. This is indicative of not only my effectiveness as a leader, but also my embodiment of the Teacher leadership style. </p>
									<p>If I had to pick another leadership experience that symbolizes my Teacher leadership style, I would pick my tutoring classes, which I have been doing for the past 3 years since early grade 10. It’s in the name—Teacher. It goes without saying that to be a successful tutor, I’ve had to embody the Teacher leadership in full. From planning class material, to delivering engaging lessons, to providing helpful feedback, every step of the process has elements of the Teacher leadership style. For this reason, I would call this one of my more prominent examples of Teacher leadership embodiment. </p>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/computerclass.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/phys2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>An example that perhaps portrays my embodiment of the Teacher leadership style the best is my self-learning of math and physics courses for the past two years. Since grade 11, I have taken advantage of resources such as the textbooks and online tutorials to teach myself several math courses and physics courses. This evidently exemplifies my ability to learn through personal analysis and critical thinking rather than relying on a teacher. I feel at home in my mind, using intellectual energy to teach myself and others complex concepts in math, calculus, and physics. Teaching myself has given me other benefits in addition to developing my Teacher leadership style. I have truly learned to study on my own terms effectively, using efficient methods of task and time management. This is another example that shows how I represent the Teacher leadership style. </p>

										<h2>Me as a Leader</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am always looking for more opportunities to develop my growing accumulation of leadership experience. This mindset has led me to have countless instances where I have had to be a leader, whether it be in my math/physics class, or Sunday martial arts class, or even Student Council events. A skill that I have developed over my various leadership positions is the ability to seamlessly switch between leadership styles based on the task/project at hand as well as the individuals in the team (and other factors too). For some projects, I will adopt an autocratic leadership style while for others, I can make use of a collaborative or charismatic leadership style—it all depends on the people/task factors.  </p>
									<p>One example of me implementing the collaborative leadership style could be my leadership position in the 2022/2023 Salaheddin Islamic School Science Fair. Because this event was the first Student Council event involving all high school, the collaborative leadership style was the obvious choice for me as it allowed me to encourage team members to participate and collaborate in decision making and information-sharing. I worked as a leader who provided resources and facilitated various things. For example, if a team within the Science Fair project needed certain materials or more volunteers, they would report their needs to me. It was my responsibility to ensure that every team had the things they needed. Also, as a collaborative leader it was my duty to ensure that everyone’s opinion was considered before making a final decision. This was key in determining the Science Fair theme (Environmentalism) as well as the judging criteria. My critical thinking and interpersonal skills allowed me to effectively perform my duties while seamlessly analyzing my performance at the same time.</p>
								</div>

							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<p>Analyzing my performance has permitted to me identify an area that I would change about this Science Fair event. To understand what and why I would change it, it is important to go over the procedure that I helped create for this event. The 5-step procedure is as follows:</p>
								</div>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/sciencefair2.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<ol>
										<li>Devising initial Science Fair plans, which includes a Science Fair theme, activity ideas, judging criteria, science fair project guidelines, and logistics. </li>
										<li>Assigning high school volunteers to the activity ideas (nicknamed “sub-projects”), outreaching to elementary students about upcoming science fair.</li>
										<li>Making final preparations before science fair, ensuring all sub-projects are ready to go, making schedules for the Science Fair and sharing with teachers/volunteers.</li>
										<li>On the day of the Science Fair, going around grades to judge individuals while managing any issues that arise from sub-projects.</li>
										<li>Calculating averages and giving final winner verdicts based on judging criteria/results, getting feedback from students, teachers, and volunteers to assess success. </li>
									  </ol>
								</div>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/checklist.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<p>If I had to change one thing, it would be related to procedure 4—the one regarding matters happening on the actual Science Fair day. Due to lack of disciplinary measures, the students (especially younger ones) caused much disruption and chaos. Therefore, one thing I would change would be to have certain teachers or individuals in charge of dealing with misbehaving children. This way, the situation would be improved. </p>
									<p>In sum, the 2022/2023 Science Fair was an event where took a leadership role and used the collaborative leadership style to see the event through to the end. I used skills such as collaboration, planning, project management, and other interpersonal skills. Overall, the event went smoothly for the most part, and the feedback was positive.</p>

										<h2>Communication</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Communication is to a an effective team as blood is to the human body—without it, teams would not function. Communication allows critical information to be passed from sender to receiver while making the encoding and decoding process as seamless as possible. Therefore, barriers to communication are serious hindrances in the proper execution of tasks in a team setting. </p>
									
									<p>In my various leadership roles, there have been instances where communication barriers caused problems. One specific time I experienced a communication barrier was during this year’s Eid Festival. There were communication gaps across the whole Student Council and subordinate high school volunteers, not just me. After analyzing the matters, I can deduce that the main barrier to communication was information overload.</p>
								</div>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/comms.webp" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<p>Information overload: due to the various methods of communication and the sheer amount of information being sent and received, people end up forgetting most of the information. Among the things they forget is important instructions regarding a certain matter. In our Eid Festival case, because planning started so late, there was a lot to do only a few days before the day of the event. This meant that lots of information had to be passed to-and-fro, resulting in information overload between the Student Council members and high school volunteers. The result was that some materials were not collected/bought, high school volunteers were confused about their roles, and schedules were not being maintained. </p>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/cal1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/eid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Now I realize that we should have started the planning process a lot earlier, although I also acknowledge the reason why this was not done in the first place. Everyone was engaged in the worship and prayer of the last 10 nights of Ramadan, which meant there was less focus on school matters and more focus on worship—which is good. Next time, I would start the planning process before the last 10 days of Ramadan to avoid this issue and hopefully give the children a better Eid Festival experience. </p>

										<h2>Event Planning</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As a leader, I have led many events over the years. One event that I helped lead was the Pancake Breakfast Day early this academic year. Being the first event of the Student Council, it was an opportunity for all members, executives and other members alike, to really get a feel for event planning. We were prepared for things to go wrong—as per Murphy’s law—but tried our best to plan for every scenario. The even plan, in broad, was as follows:</p>
								</div>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/pancake.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<ol>
										<li>Council executives would write up an Event Master Plan, which would include broad and specific details about the Pancake Breakfast Day. Objectives, financial logistics, location, and student management plans were all detailed in the Event Master Plan.</li>
										<li>A series of meetings with all council members would bring everyone up to date and make clear all roles for the Pancake Breakfast Day. In addition, the price for the pancakes would be set in these meetings. An “ordering slip” was finalized and distributed to all the students. </li>
										<li>A database for all the incoming orders would be created in the third step of event planning. Here, the total tally of the orders would be summed up to make financial logistics easy. At this step, a schedule for the event would also be created to keep everyone organized on the day of the event. </li>
										<li>On the day of the event, Council members who had their roles assigned would go to their stations to ensure everything would run smoothly. There would be people in the kitchen making the pancakes, people in the gym serving the students, and people going around the school managing incoming and outgoing students. </li>
										<li>Cleanup: this task would be shared by all students. People in the kitchen would be in charge of cleaning up the kitchen, and likewise people in the gym would be responsible for cleaning up the gym. </li>
									  </ol>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<span class="image"><img src="images/projman.webp" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Overall, I would say that my good team-working performance allowed me to perform all my duties to the best of my abilities. My knowledge about team-management and leadership was increased, and this experience was crucial to planning all the later Student Council events. Identifying some areas of improvement allowed everyone, not just me, to see the flaws in our teamworking setting. One area of improvement would be to better manage the money that people were sending in. There were some problems with people sending in the incorrect among of money and others requesting change. This is one area of improvement. Also, something unexpected that occurred was that we suddenly decided to change our initial plan regarding students. The plan was to let students eat in the gym before sending them back to class. However, on the day of the event, certain matters meant that we were behind schedule, so we had to suddenly change our plan. We decided to send students back to their classes right after receiving their pancakes. This was unexpected, both for the Council members and the teachers (who expected the students to finish eating in the gym before returning to class). With all of that said, I am confident that I will be tackling more and more challenging tasks in the future, such as conducting an leading more large scale events involving more people of different ages, cultures etc. The numerous Student Council events that I helped lead is a testament to this statement. </p>

										<h2>Mentoring</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>If I had to choose a mentor, the obvious answer would be my parents. However, I would like to go off the beaten track for this one by choosing another influential figure in my life. That mentor would be none other than <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lasisi-ahmed/">Dr. Ahmed Lasisi</a> whom I met in August of 2021 (just after my I turned 16). </p>
								</div>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/mentor.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="spotlight">
								<div class="content">
									<p>Dr. Ahmed Lasisi has a Bachelor’s degree, and Master’s degree, and a PhD—all in civil engineering. He has also completed his Professional Engineer license and has numerous experience working for large tech companies and researching with world-renowned research universities (like the University of Delaware and the University of Toronto).</p>

								<p>Dr. Ahmed Lasisi is more commonly known with the title of “shaykh”—and for good reason. A Hafidh of Quran, Shaykh Ahmed as much knowledge regarding the Quran, being an expert in Tajweed and knowing multiple Qira’at (styles) of reciting the Quran. The Shaykh has done several research studies at Islamic Universities, one being a Master’s thesis on tackling atheism. In addition, the Shaykh continually seeks Islamic knowledge and spends his free time taking Quran classes for kids online.</p>

								<p>Shaykh Ahmed has helped me really shape my life goals and future aspirations. He is a true example of a person who has pursued success in both Dunya and Aakhira, and that is my goal also. Being an engineering and a Shaykh, he has given me life pointers from a unique perspective, often giving me advice about important decisions. My goal is to becoming like him someday insha Allah. <br>
